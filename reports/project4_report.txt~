2. Catalog information about Index
Table Name: Indexes
Columns: {"table-id"; "table-name"; "attr-name"; "file-name";}


3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
3.1. Calculate the bufferSize = BufferPageNum * PAGE_SIZE;
3.2. Load the record from outerIterator into buffer, and set one index in the buffer
3.3. Loop in the innerIterator; if find one tuple meet the join requirement, return it; if the loop ends, increase the index
3.4. If the index reach the end of the buffer, If there are more tuples in the outerIterator, go back to step2; otherwise, return QE_EOF;

4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
4.1. Read one tuple from outerIterator;
4.2. loop the innerIterator, if find one meet the join requirement, return it;
4.3. when the loop finished, if there are more tuples in outerIterator, reset the innerIterator and go back to step1, otherwise, return QE_EOF;


5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).
Sorry, we didn't implement this function.

6. Aggregation
6.1 Basic:
It's very simple. Just simple scan the table and get the one meet requirement.

6.2 Group-Based:
Actually, I apply the std::map in my implementation. Scan the table, and set <key,value> pairs into map, the key is the value of the groupAttribute,
the value is the corresponding value of operated the groupAttr. When I scan the table, I will update the map at the same time, so the memory-cost should not be too high.
After the map is built up, I will set an index to return the content of map as the nextTuple method is called.

7. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
NO

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
Yes, Implement group-basd hash, please check the 6th section of this document;

- Other implementation details:
Nothing to report

6. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
Nothing to report
